    \caption{Overview of issues and recommendations for common classes of models. Correlation and distributions refer to predicted data from a fitted model, against which observed points are compared. A linear rotation refers to a multiplication of the simulated and observed data by a Cholesky decomposition of the estimated covariance matrix of the observed data, zâ€™=Lz, as available in DHARMa.}

    \toprule
    Model class & Case studies & Issues and causes & Recommendation\\
    \hline
    Linear model & Linear model & No issues & Pearson residuals \\
    Generalized linear model (GLM) &
    Skewed Gamma, Non-normality caused by response variable. &
    Quantile residuals are needed if not approximately normal. &
    Conditional simulation residuals or OSA CDF \\
    Linear mixed model (LMM) &
    Random walk, spatial LMM &
    Random effects cause linear correlation in predicted data. &
    Use a method that linearly decorrelates in order to scale to a unit iid normal. OSA Full Gaussian  or simulation residuals with rotation. \\
    Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) &
    Spatial Poisson, Repeated measures gamma &
    Non-normality and non-linear correlations caused by random effect structure and non-normal response variable. &
    Needs non-linear decorrelation and quantiles. OSA is only viable option.\\
